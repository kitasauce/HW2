                Andrew Zubac is professional sales associate who lives in NYC. As someone who was raised in the South Bronx, he is a real New Yorker at heart. 
                On the flip side of that, Andrew hails his routes from former Yugoslavia where most of his family was born. He spends lots of time with his family over in Dubrovnik, Croatia. 
                Andrew has worked on a variety of different projects including many from his time at Code Camp. Some of his most notable projects include Radio Reptiore- an app that lets you listen to multiple foreign radio stations. 
                Other work includes a logo maker, as well as some other feats as a skier. Feel free to browse below:
